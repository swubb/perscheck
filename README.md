# perscheck
This is a webservice that checks Dutch texts for readability. It checks sentence length, paragraph length, word frequency and length and it checks for language use.
This demo was developed for the Dutch press agency ANP. It was developed by Readab.ly in collaboration with Fontys Hogeschool and Tilburg University for the project 'Watch and Learn'
The package is written in Python and can be run as a Flask webservice.

Data that is used is the ANP press release benchmark, part of the Dutch Google Ngram corpus, and a wordlist obtained from heldernederlands.nl. All files are included.
